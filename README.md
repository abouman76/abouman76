# Hi you all,
I am Arnoud and i graduated from Novi Hogeschool as a frontend developer.

You can check out my repository's and see what i did so far. For example ["Sociaal Oosterhout"](https://github.com/abouman76/Eind-Project-Arnoud-Bouman.git) which is a social platform application and was build with React and uses Firebase as a "backend" database. This was my final project for Novi Hogeschool. I also integrated Cypress Automation Tests to this project.

:arrow_left:  In my profile you can find my coding skills. JavaScript is the only language so far, but working on other skills, like JEST and Cypress and combining my developing skills with testing skills.

- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently studying for my ISTQB Certification

I am currently looking for the opportunity to work as a _QA-Engineer_ or a combination of _QA-Engineer and frontend developer_. So please, do reach out to me if you want to talk!
