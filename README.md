# Hi you all,
I am Arnoud and i graduated from Novi Hogeschool as a frontend developer and currently developing my testing skills. I recently completed Cypress Automation Testing (online) course.

You can check out my repository's and see what i did so far. For example ["Sociaal Oosterhout"](https://github.com/abouman76/Eind-Project-Arnoud-Bouman.git) which is a social platform application and was build with React and uses Firebase as a "backend" database. This was my final project for Novi Hogeschool. I also integrated Cypress Automation Tests to this project.

:arrow_left:  In my profile you can find my coding skills. JavaScript is the only language so far, but working on other skills and combining my developing skills with testing skills.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning TypeScript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m planning to get my a ISTQB Certification in the near future.

I am seeking the opportunity to work as a Test Automation Engineer or a combination as a frontend developer and Test Automation Engineer. So please, do reach out to me if you want to talk!
