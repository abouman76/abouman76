# Hi you all,
I am Arnoud and i hope to graduate from Novi Hogeschool as a frontend developer before the end of june 2021.

You can check out my repository's and see what i did so far. For example ["Sociaal Oosterhout"](https://github.com/abouman76/Eind-Project-Arnoud-Bouman.git) which is a social platform application and was build with React and uses Firebase as a "backend" database. This was my final project for Novi Hogeschool.

:arrow_left: In my profile you can find my coding skills. JavaScript is the only language so far, but working on other skills, like JEST and combine my developing skills with testing skills.

I am currently looking for the opportunity to work as a _junior frontend developer_ and perhaps combine this with a traineeship as a _Test Automation Engineer_. So please, do reach out to me if you want to talk!
